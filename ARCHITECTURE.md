## Readiness Summary

Assembly Incomplete: 4/4 critical baseline checks passed, security scaffold detected, executable probe not configured, and 3 generator validation issue(s) remain.

## Scaffold Evaluation Path

**Review this scaffold before calling it production-ready:**

1. **📖 Review Architecture** (10 min)
   - Read this document
   - Review generated structure
    - Scan structural readiness checks below

2. **🧩 Verify Composition Root** (10-20 min)
    - Confirm entrypoint assembles routes/modules/middleware
    - Confirm dependency manifest installs cleanly
    - Confirm config bootstrap matches your environment

3. **🧪 Execute Baseline Checks** (15-30 min)
    - Run the framework install/build command
    - Run the generated test contract
    - Hit a smoke endpoint locally

4. **🚀 Harden for Production** (variable)
    - Implement domain logic and integration details
    - Close remaining validation issues
    - Deploy only after staging verification

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack

{}

### Why These Choices?

- **Auto**: Production-proven framework chosen for Auto's specific strengths
- **Production-grade**: Dependencies are battle-tested and widely supported
- **Scalable**: Architecture supports horizontal scaling out of the box
- **Maintainable**: Clean code structure follows industry best practices

> **💡 Tip:** Architecture is modular - swap components as needed (e.g., PostgreSQL → MySQL, add Redis caching)

### 🔧 Auto-Fixed Violations (6 files removed)

**OrchesityAI automatically detected and removed these files to ensure architecture quality:**

6 files were removed during generation:
- Duplicate files (same functionality in multiple locations)
- Wrong framework patterns (e.g., Python code in JavaScript project)
- Mixed file extensions (contaminating files from wrong language)
- Multiple entry points (consolidated to single main file)
- Configuration duplicates (kept canonical version only)

**✅ These violations were fixed BEFORE writing to disk** - verify the remaining validation issues below before calling the scaffold clean.

**Why we removed them:**
- Prevents code confusion and maintenance nightmares
- Ensures framework purity (no cross-framework contamination)
- Follows industry best practices (single source of truth)
- Improves IDE performance (no conflicting files)

> **Note:** Removed files are logged during generation. Check console output for details.

## Validation Results

### Structural Readiness Checks

#### Passed

- **Output directory present**: PASS - Generated files are available for download.
- **Dependency manifest present**: PASS - Cargo.toml
- **Entrypoint present**: PASS - src/main.rs
- **Composition root wired**: PASS - src/main.rs
- **Configuration bootstrap present**: PASS - .env.example
- **Auth or middleware scaffold present**: PASS - src/auth.rs

#### Failing / Pending

- **Executable test contract scaffolded**: FAIL - Rust tests exist but do not reference coherent crate symbols or mounted route contracts
- **Executable validation probe**: FAIL - No executable probe configured for Rust/Auto

### Generator Validation Issues

### ⚠️ Issues Requiring Attention (3 items)

**1. DUPLICATE FILE: user.rs appears 2 times at: src/user.rs, src/models/user.rs - Same file should not exist in multiple directories. Choose one canonical location.**
   - Severity: 🟢 LOW
   - Est. fix: ~3-5 minutes

**2. package.json: Wrong package manager for Auto - use Cargo.lock, Cargo.toml instead**
   - Severity: 🟢 LOW
   - Est. fix: ~3-5 minutes

**3. [CRITICAL] src/main.rs:3 - Actix-Web requires async main function
  Fix: Change 'fn main()' to 'async fn main()' and add appropriate attribute**
   - Severity: 🔴 HIGH
   - Est. fix: ~3-5 minutes

## How OrchesityAI Generated This

### Intelligence Applied

1. **Framework Constitution**: Code follows Auto's philosophy strictly - no cross-framework contamination
2. **Dependency Resolution**: MIT's Propagator Networks (1975) resolve conflicts automatically
3. **Production Learning**: Benefits from production best practices real deployment patterns
4. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints catch bugs at development time

### Common Customization Points

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Business Logic | `services/` | Implement domain logic |
| Database Schema | `models/` | Define data models |
| API Endpoints | `api/` or `routes/` | Add new endpoints |
| Authentication | `auth/` | Customize auth logic |
